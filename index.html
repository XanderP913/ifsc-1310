<h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
<p> 
  Progressive Enhancement is a way in which a website is presented to a browser. In this case this type of website is focused on the content within it rather than that of the presentation and client-side scripting. Of course presentation and client siding is still needed but its more of an accompaniment to the content. Being able bring out what is best of your content in a clear way but still captures overall idea of maintaining the focus of the information you are trying to present. This type of web development is important due to the fact that it focueses on the audience and their ideals. This is most in part to how they navigate and read the information on the website, in other words the websites accessiblity to the information within it.
