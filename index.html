<h2> Revision and Reflection Assignment</h2>
<p>
  After having a few people look at the first website for SpaceX Dragon, all of them were rather impressed in what I had made. Before taking this class, while I was in high school and making some sort of webpage was required for some projects throughout those four years. In order to accomplish these few assignments making a website through a template was utlilized. Because of my sibilings same background in this, they found it rather impressive that I made the website using code rather than those defualt templates. Although they were impressed with what I had done, some of them did have a couple of remarks in what I could do better. The most prominent of these being the color of the SpaceX title on the webpage. The contrast between the background and this title were almost nonexistent making it hard to read. Besides a couple of smaller remarks of how it may have looked a little plain, they were overall seemed pretty satisfied with the overall composition.

  I feel as though I may have slowed my own learning experience for this course. I found myself especially throughout the project struggling to understand why things might not work they way I wished them to or just try not completely understanding the css code I needed to type for certain sections. When creating and editing the Dragon Project I found myself overcoming a lot of obstacles as well. One of the best feelings was when tampering with code and finally getting it right. With that being said, I do believe that it could've been avoided less if I had focused more throughout this course. I found myself not looking back at lecture recordings as much as the semester closed. This is also something that I would've changed if I could go back.

<h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
<p> 
  Progressive Enhancement is a way in which a website is presented to a browser. In this case this type of website is focused on the content within it rather than that of the presentation and client-side scripting. Of course presentation and client siding is still needed but its more of an accompaniment to the content. Being able bring out what is best of your content in a clear way but still captures overall idea of maintaining the focus of the information you are trying to present. This type of web development is important due to the fact that it focueses on the audience and their ideals. This is most in part to how they navigate and read the information on the website, in other words the websites accessiblity to the information within it.
